# Final-proj-
My project is zombie land, a shooter game.\
One of the difficutlies i faced with this project is that i was sick for the majority of the time we had to work on it which gave me verryyyy little time to work.\
I also struggled with the creative process as i had too many options to go with for this project and tend to be ambitious about my projects, so i had planned to make a bigger project by incorporating game development via godot and making a discord bot but unfortunately i had to scrap my entire orignial idea due to the time constraint, which was also the reason for the game not looking pretty.\
Despite the adversities this project was very fun and educational, i got to learn a new coding language (GDScript), was introduced to many new ideas throughout working on it, and it challenged my problem solving skills, as some parts of my code was giving errors that didnt make sense even after hours of debugging and asking around.\
The first challenge was learning GDScript in such short time.\
The second as i mentioned were random errors that would pop up in my code even after I tried following instructions online and asking around many forums for a bug I might've missed. All these efforts proved unfruitful, so I tried to do it in many different ways until i got it to work.\
The third is more of a personal challenge, as I mentioned, I tend to be too abitious when working on projects so it was extremely difficult to keep it down to the very basics to meet the deadline. I often found myself getting carried away with adding more advanced or broader ideas to the project and it was very challenging for me to ignore them and at least have a simple complete project for some credit.\
I extremely enjoyed working on this project since it was my first actual attempt at game development, which is something i've been passionate about for a long time. It just confirmed passion for pursuing game development, I plan on mastering godot and turning my visions into well-made games. I also plan to keep working on this zombie land project after this semester is done to practice and expand my knowledge.\
I plan on adding sound effects, a background of course, more and better visuals, animating the moving components such as the player and the zombies, and adding more to the gameplay such as obstacles, power ups, various additional enemies with different atributes, and making the zomb ie with the gun actually shoot. \
